# Introduction to Algorithms

These are my notes, and solutions to the book [Introduction to Algorithms 3rd edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262033844/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0262033844&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20&linkId=BT6PH7XFWAKI4BUC) by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson , Ronald L. Rivest , and Clifford Stein.

# Solutions

Solutions are written in Common LISP, typically contain instructions on how to run.
In general, I use ```clisp -i 'the file' ``` to run a console with the file already loaded.
